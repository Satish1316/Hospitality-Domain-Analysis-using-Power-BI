**Hospitality Domain Analysis Using Power BI**

1. **Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing the hospitality data to help a fictional hotel improve its business strategies. The analysis includes revenue performance, guest preferences, and operational insights based on hotel stays, room types, booking sources, and seasonal trends.

The goal of this project is to provide key insights and recommendations that the hotel management can use to enhance its guest experience, optimize room offerings, and better target its clientele.

2. **Project Goals**
- Develop essential metrics based on the provided dataset.
- Construct a dashboard following the stakeholder requirements.
- Generate actionable insights that go beyond the predefined metric list and dashboard mockup.

3. **Import & Explore Data**
A. **Importing Data into Power BI**  
The hospitality data was imported into Power BI. The data consists of both fact and dimension tables that include booking transactions, room details, and customer information.

B. **Using SQL to Explore Data**  
Exploring the data before diving into analysis helps understand guest behavior, room preferences, and booking patterns.

**Dataset Overview**:  
- **dim_rooms**: This table contains information about room types, pricing, and occupancy capacity.  
- **dim_bookings**: This table lists the booking details such as booking IDs, dates, and sources.  
- **fact_stays**: This fact table includes transactions with booking IDs, room IDs, nights stayed, and total amount spent.  
- **fact_guests**: Contains guest data such as guest IDs, location, and booking history.

4. **Data Modelling**  
Data modeling forms the backbone of the analysis. In this project, the data was modeled using Power BIâ€™s Power Query. The following steps were taken:
- Data cleaning, formatting, and transformation using Power Query.
- Establishing relationships among tables using the Star Schema.
- Validating the data based on stakeholder-defined metrics.

5. **Dashboard Designing**
Based on the stakeholder mockups, the following views were designed:
